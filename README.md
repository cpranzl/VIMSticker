# VIMSticker

VIMSticker, as you can guess by the name, are stickers with vi/vim-commands. I designed them with my own Rapoo E9050 Blade Series Wireless Kompakt Ultra-slim keyboard in mind.

I first created the stickers in Microsoft Visio 2013 but the exported SVG files imported badly in the Silhouette Studio which i use to cut them. So i redesigned all sticker in inkscape which is known creating correct SVG files.
